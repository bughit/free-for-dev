  "body": "# free-for-dev\r\nDevelopers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all in order to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\nThis is list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.\r\n\r\nYou can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Once I have a good set of links in this README file, I'll look into a better layout for the information and links (help with that is appreciated too).\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self hosted software.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n=================\r\n\r\n   * [Source Code Repos](#source-code-repos)\r\n   * [Tools for Teams and Collaboration](#tools-for-teams-and-collaboration)\r\n   * [Code Quality](#code-quality)\r\n   * [Code Search and Browsing](#code-search-and-browsing)\r\n   * [CI / CD](#ci--cd)\r\n   * [Automated Browser Testing](#automated-browser-testing)\r\n   * [Security and PKI](#security-and-pki)\r\n   * [Management Systems](#management-system)\r\n   * [Log Management](#log-management)\r\n   * [Translation Management](#translation-management)\r\n   * [Monitoring](#monitoring)\r\n   * [Crash and Exception Handling](#crash-and-exception-handling)\r\n   * [Search](#search)\r\n   * [Email](#email)\r\n   * [CDN and Protection](#cdn-and-protection)\r\n   * [PaaS](#paas)\r\n   * [BaaS](#baas)\r\n   * [Web Hosting](#web-hosting)\r\n   * [DNS](#dns)\r\n   * [IaaS](#iaas)\r\n   * [DBaaS](#dbaas)\r\n   * [STUN, WebRTC, Web Socket Servers and Other Routers](#stun-webrtc-web-socket-servers-and-other-routers)\r\n   * [Issue Tracking and Project Management](#issue-tracking-and-project-management)\r\n   * [Storage and Media Processing](#storage-and-media-processing)\r\n   * [Design and UI](#design-and-ui)\r\n   * [Data Visualization on Maps](#data-visualization-on-maps)\r\n   * [Package Build System](#package-build-system)\r\n   * [IDE and Code Editing](#ide-and-code-editing)\r\n   * [Analytics, Events and Statistics](#analytics-events-and-statistics)\r\n   * [International Mobile Number Verification API and SDK](#international-mobile-number-verification-api-and-sdk)\r\n   * [Payment / Billing Integration](#payment--billing-integration)\r\n   * [Docker Related](#docker-related)\r\n   * [Vagrant Related](#vagrant-related)\r\n   * [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\r\n   * [APIs, Data, and ML](#apis-data-and-ml)\r\n   * [Other Free Resources](#other-free-resources)\r\n\r\n## Source Code Repos\r\n\r\n  * [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) — Free unlimited public and private repos (Git and Mercurial) for up to 5 users\r\n  * [chiselapp.com](http://chiselapp.com/) — Unlimited public and private Fossil repositories\r\n  * [github.com](https://github.com/) — Free for an unlimited number of public repositories\r\n  * [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) — Unlimited public and private Git repos with unlimited collaborators\r\n  * [hub.jazz.net](https://hub.jazz.net/) — Unlimited public repos, private repos free for up to 3 accounts\r\n  * [visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/) — Free unlimited private repos (Git and TFS) for up to 5 users per team\r\n  * [fogcreek.com](https://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/) — Free unlimited public and private repos (hybrid of Git and Mercurial) for 2 users\r\n  * [plasticscm.com](https://plasticscm.com/) — Free for individuals, OSS and nonprofits organizations\r\n  * [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-repositories/) — Free private Git repositories hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
